**Notes**
- [1] Multi-room master server functionality is disabled by default on Raspberry Pi 1 family devices due to performance constraints.
- [2] Not tested. Feel free to share your results.
- [3] Currently balenaSound can not run on balenaOS 64 bit versions, please use 32 bit alternative. See this [issue](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/issues/82) for more information and an up to date status.
- [4] There is a [known issue](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/1444) with all variants of the Raspberry Pi 3 where Bluetooth and WiFi interfere with each other. This will only impact the performance of balenaSound if you use a **Pi 3 as the master server to do multi-room bluetooth streaming**, resulting in stuttering audio (Airplay and Spotify Connect will work fine, as well as all streaming methods with multi-room disabled). In this case we recommend the use of a Raspberry Pi 4 as the `master` server or a Pi 3 with a bluetooth dongle.
